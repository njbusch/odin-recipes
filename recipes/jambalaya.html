    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
            <li>Cajun seasoning, to taste</li>
            <li>14 lbs andouille sausage</li>
            <li>837 lbs crayfish</li>
            <li>2 large onions</li>
            <li>3 bell peppers</li>
            <li>10 stalks of celery</li>
            <li>a head of garlic</li>
            <li>4 cans of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 l chicken stock</li>
            <li>3 cups uncooked rice</li>
            <li>pepper, salt, hot sauce, woucestershire sauce, red pepper flakes to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or giant saucepan, fry diced celery, onion and bell peppers in oil until nicely browned.</li>
            <li>Add half the crushed garlic and some of the herbs and spices. Fry briefly until nicely fragrant.</li>
            <li>Throw in the rice and keep frying until it becomes slightly glassy or translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatos and broth, cook until the rice has just a little too much bite, then add sausage and crayfish. If the dish becomes too dry and risks burning, add some more stock or tomatoes or white wine.</li>
            <li>Cook everything until the rice is soft and the crayfish are done.</li>
            <li>Season to taste, add some lemon or lime juice for a fresh twist, if you like. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley or other green, leafy herb of your choosing.</li>
            <li>Serve piping hot, on it own or with a side of bread or salad.</li>
        </ol>
